# task-tracker
A **simple Python CLI** for managing tasks. Add, update, delete, and organize tasks with statuses like **"In Progress"** and **"Done"**. Supports saving/loading tasks to/from **JSON** files. This is an easy-to-use tool for managing to-do lists directly from the terminal.

---

## Features

- **Add**, **update**, and **delete** tasks.
- Mark tasks as **"In Progress"** or **"Done"**.
- List tasks based on their status: 
  - All tasks
  - Todo
  - In Progress
  - Done
- Save and load tasks from a **JSON** file.
- **Help** guide for usage instructions.

---

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- External modules: `json`, `datetime`

---

## Files

- **`main.py`**: The main script that handles user input and calls functions from **`utils.py`**.
- **`utils.py`**: Contains the logic for managing tasks (add, update, delete, etc.) and reading/writing tasks to a file.
- **`validator.py`**: Contains functions for input validation (e.g., checking valid task IDs).
- **`help.txt`**: Contains instructions for using the task management CLI (optional).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>

2. Install dependencies:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
Ensure that help.txt exists for the help command, or modify the code to handle missing files.

## Usage

Run the program by executing main.py:

      ```bash
      python main.py

Once the program is running, you can enter the following commands:

## Commands:

- **Add a Task:**

  ```bash
      add <task_description>

Adds a new task to the list with the given description.

- **Update a Task:**

      ```bash
      update <task_id> <new_description>

  Updates the description of the task with the specified ID.

- **Delete a Task:**

      ```bash
      delete <task_id>

  Deletes the task with the specified ID.

- **Mark Task as "In Progress":**

        ```bash
      mark in_progress <task_id>

  Marks the task as "In Progress".

- **Mark Task as "Done":**
 
            ```bash
            mark done <task_id>

   Marks the task as "Done".

- **List All Tasks:**

              ```bash
            list

   Lists tasks marked as "Done".

- **List "Todo" Tasks:**

                ```bash
               list todo

   Lists tasks that have not been started yet.

- **Save Tasks to File:**

                ```bash
               save <file_path>

  Saves the current task list to a .json file.

- **Load Tasks from File:**

               ```bash
               load <file_path>

  Loads tasks from a saved .json file.

- **Help:**

                 ```bash
                 help

  Displays the help text explaining how to use the program.

- **Exit:**

                 ```bash
                 exit

  Exits the program.

  ## Example:

  - **Add a task:**
 
                   ```bash
                   >> add Finish the report
                   Task successfully added

  - **List all tasks:**
 
                   ```bash
                  All tasks:
                  1. Finish the report | Status: None

  - **Mark a task as done:**
 
                   ```bash
                   >> mark done 1
                   Task successfully set to be done

  - **Save tasks:**
   
                  ```bash
                  >> save tasks_list
                  Successfully saved as tasks_list.json

  - **Load tasks:**
 
                  ```bash
                  >> load tasks_list
                  File successfully loaded

    ## How It Works

    **Task Management:**
Tasks are stored in a list as dictionaries. Each task has the following attributes:

- **description**: A short text describing the task.
- **status**: A string indicating the task's status (None, 'In Progress', or 'Done').
- **createdAt**: The timestamp when the task was created.
- **updatedAt:**: The timestamp when the task was last updated.

  **Input Parsing and Command Handling:**
The program continuously asks for user input. Commands are parsed and matched using Python's match statement to execute the corresponding function in utils.py.

  **Validation:**
Input is validated (e.g., ensuring the task ID is valid, and the correct number of arguments is provided for each command).

                  ### Key Highlights:
                  1. **Bold text** for key sections like "Features", "Commands", "Example", etc.
                  2. **Code blocks** for commands, examples, and file contents.
                  3. **Headings** for better structure and navigation.
                  4. Lists are used to make the features and requirements easier to read.
                  
                  This should give your `README.md` a more professional and engaging appearance on GitHub!
